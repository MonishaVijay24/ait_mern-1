map, filter, reduce

The map method is used to access all elements of a list/array and do something with it.
For example, I want to add bonus of Rs.1000/- to salary of every employee whose details are available in the list.

The filter method is used to get the filtered objects from the list on some filtering cretiria.
For example, I want the list of employees who are not from Bengaluru.
OR, I want the list of employees who are working as developers.

The reduce method is used to deduce/calculate some value using the elements/objects of the list.
For example, to calsulate the sum of all salaries of the employees.
Or to find the employee with highest salary.
